<h1> Reading On The Go </h1>	
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Listen Anytime, Anywhere</h2>
<p>Whether lounging on the sofa at home, surrounded by nature in the park, or sneaking a few moments of peace in a quiet corner at work or school sometimes nothing is better than a good book. In the past, the only way you could enjoy this hobby was to have to have a physical book to look at and read, thankfully that is no longer the case. Thanks to the evolution of technology, it is now possible to carry an entire library in the palm of your hand. The best thing about audiobooks for me is the flexibility they afford. I can tackle various household chores like cleaning or laundry and still enjoy stories from my favorite authors. Audiobooks are also a nice change from listening to music while working out. </p>

<p>Recorded audio is not a new phenomenon. In fact, what we call “audiobooks” first emerged in 1932 when the American Foundation for the Blind created vinyl recordings of books for the visually impaired. Since then, as recording and storage technologies have advanced, so too has the method of delivery and availability of content. Today, there are virtually no limits to the kinds of content available in audiobook catalogues. Consumers simply have to decide if they want free content or if a paid subscription is more appropriate for their needs. But if a person has a mobile device, they only a few clicks away from the wonderful world of audiobooks.
